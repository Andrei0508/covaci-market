Below is a step-by-step guide on how to wire up your **Node.js/Express + MongoDB** backend with your **React + Redux Toolkit** frontend so that registration and login work end to end. 

---

## 1. Remove the “Mock API” Code
Right now, your frontend’s `authApi` is mocking requests using `queryFn` instead of actually calling your Express server. We want to remove the mock logic and let RTK Query hit your real `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` endpoints.

**What we have now (mock):**

```ts
login: builder.mutation<AuthResponse, LoginRequest>({
  queryFn: async ({ email, password }) => {
    // Mock logic...
  },
}),
```

We will replace that with a real request:

```ts
login: builder.mutation<AuthResponse, LoginRequest>({
  query: (credentials) => ({
    url: '/auth/login',        // matches your Express route
    method: 'POST',
    body: credentials,         // { email, password } goes to req.body
  }),
  transformResponse: (response) => {
    // We'll shape the response object so it matches your `AuthResponse` interface
    return {
      user: {
        id: response._id,
        email: response.email,
        name: response.fullName,
      },
      token: response.token,
    };
  },
}),
```

---

## 2. Adjust the Backend Return Shape
Your Node.js routes currently return user data like this (from `register` and `login`):

```js
res.json({
  ...userData,
  token,
});
```

Which might look like:
```json
{
  "_id": "<some ObjectId>",
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "role": "buyer",
  "token": "<jwt token>"
}
```

But your frontend is expecting an object shaped like:
```ts
{
  user: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    name: string;
  },
  token: string;
}
```

### Two Approaches

1. **Approach A**: Leave your backend as-is, and **transform** the backend response on the frontend so it fits your `AuthResponse` interface.
2. **Approach B**: Change your backend so that it sends back the shape your frontend wants.

**Both are fine**. Often, the *transform* approach (Approach A) is simpler if you don’t want to change your backend code. Below, we’ll use *Approach A* (transforming in RTK Query).

---

## 3. Update the RTK Query “authApi”

Inside `authApi.ts` (or wherever you define your RTK Query endpoints), **remove** the old mock code and define real endpoints that call your Express server. For example:

```ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react';

interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
}

interface AuthResponse {
  user: User;
  token: string;
}

interface LoginRequest {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

interface RegisterRequest extends LoginRequest {
  name: string; // because we pass fullName on the backend
}

export const authApi = createApi({
  reducerPath: 'authApi',
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    // If your server is at http://localhost:4444
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4444',
  }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    // 1. LOGIN
    login: builder.mutation<AuthResponse, LoginRequest>({
      query: (credentials) => ({
        url: '/auth/login',
        method: 'POST',
        body: credentials, // { email, password }
      }),
      transformResponse: (response: any) => {
        // The Node server returns { _id, email, fullName, token, ... }
        return {
          user: {
            id: response._id,
            email: response.email,
            name: response.fullName,
          },
          token: response.token,
        };
      },
    }),

    // 2. REGISTER
    register: builder.mutation<AuthResponse, RegisterRequest>({
      query: (data) => ({
        url: '/auth/register',
        method: 'POST',
        // Node’s endpoint expects { email, fullName, password } 
        // (and optionally role, etc.)
        body: {
          email: data.email,
          fullName: data.name,
          password: data.password,
        },
      }),
      transformResponse: (response: any) => {
        return {
          user: {
            id: response._id,
            email: response.email,
            name: response.fullName,
          },
          token: response.token,
        };
      },
    }),
  }),
});

// Auto-generated React hooks from RTK Query
export const { useLoginMutation, useRegisterMutation } = authApi;
```

### Important Notes
1. Make sure your Node.js server is actually running at `http://localhost:4444` (or wherever you have it). 
2. If you’re running your React dev server on port 3000, you *might* run into CORS issues. You have already set `app.use(cors())` in your backend, which should allow cross-origin requests. Ensure you configured it properly.

---

## 4. Use the `useRegisterMutation` and `useLoginMutation` Hooks
Now that we have real endpoints, we can adjust your React components to use them.

### 4.1. **Register** Component
Your `Register` component uses:

```ts
const [register, { isLoading }] = useRegisterMutation();
```

Then calls:
```ts
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setError('');

  try {
    // We pass { name, email, password } to our new real query
    const result = await register({ name, email, password }).unwrap();
    dispatch(setCredentials(result));
    navigate('/', { replace: true });
  } catch (err) {
    setError(t('auth.register.error'));
  }
};
```

Because of our `transformResponse`, `result` will look like:
```ts
{
  user: {
    id: "someId",
    email: "some@example.com",
    name: "John Doe",
  },
  token: "eyJhbGci..."
}
```

You’re then dispatching `setCredentials(result)` in your Redux store. That’s typically how you’d store `user` and `token` in your global state.

**If you also want to store user role** (buyer/seller/admin) from the backend, you can add it to the transform:

```ts
transformResponse: (response: any) => {
  return {
    user: {
      id: response._id,
      email: response.email,
      name: response.fullName,
      role: response.role // pass the role down if needed
    },
    token: response.token,
  };
},
```

Then store that too in your Redux slice (and use it across the app as needed).

### 4.2. **Login** Component
Your `Login` page would be very similar: call the `useLoginMutation()`, then do `await login({ email, password }).unwrap()`. That triggers your Node backend’s `/auth/login` endpoint.  

---

## 5. Make Sure the Backend is Running
On your Node/Express + MongoDB side:

1. **Set up `.env`** with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to your local or hosted MongoDB.
2. **Run** `npm install` (for any missing dependencies).
3. **Start** the server: `node index.js` or `npm run dev` (depending on your setup).
4. Confirm in the console you see “db works” (meaning Mongo connected) and “Server works” for the Express app on port 4444.

---

## 6. Confirm the Flow
1. **Go to** your React `/register` page.
2. Enter name, email, password, and click “Sign Up”.
3. Check your Express server console to see if a `POST /auth/register` request came in. If successful, you should see a new user in your MongoDB. The server should respond with the JSON that includes `_id`, `fullName`, `token`, etc.
4. The frontend `transformResponse` will shape that data, and you should see the `dispatch(setCredentials())` store the user and token in Redux.
5. **Repeat** for Login if you have a dedicated Login page or process.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting
- **CORS Issues**: If you get CORS errors in the browser console, ensure your `app.use(cors())` is properly set and that the server is actually on the correct port (`localhost:4444`).
- **Proxy**: Alternatively, you can set a proxy in your React dev environment (`package.json` → `"proxy": "http://localhost:4444"`) and keep `baseUrl: '/'` in your RTK Query, but that depends on your project structure.
- **Network Errors**: Check the browser’s dev tools for the **actual** request/response. If you see a 500/404, verify your Express routes exactly match what your frontend expects.
- **Validation**: The code includes `registerValidation` and `loginValidation` in your routes. Make sure your JSON structure from the frontend matches what these validators require. If your validators require something like `fullName`, you must send that from your React “Register” form (which we do via `{ fullName: data.name }`).

---

## Final Summary
1. **Backend**:
   - Routes:  
     - `POST /auth/register` → Creates user, returns JSON with user’s data + token.  
     - `POST /auth/login` → Verifies user, returns JSON with user’s data + token.  
     - `GET /auth/me` → Returns logged in user’s data if authenticated.
   - Make sure the response from each route returns the fields you need.

2. **Frontend** (React + Redux Toolkit):
   - Use [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) with `fetchBaseQuery`.
   - `register` → `POST /auth/register`
   - `login` → `POST /auth/login`
   - Transform the response so it matches your `AuthResponse` structure.
   - Dispatch the result into your Redux store to keep track of `user` and `token`.

With this setup, you’ll have **end-to-end** registration and login using your real Node/Express backend and your React client. Keep experimenting and reading official docs to deepen your understanding!
